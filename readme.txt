WPnaked Responsive Styled
============

A responsive and styled starter theme for Wordpress projects.

Super minimal theme both front end and back end, adding as little bloat as possible.

With none of those custom functions, or funny naming conventions that so many other "blank" theme developers seem to force on you. Wordpress default or generic naming conventions and functions have been followed to enable you to make the theme totally yours for your next Wordpress project.

Includes by default:
- fluidvids.js to display embeded videos responsively at 100% width.
- html5shiv.js for ie9 and below support of HTML5 elements.
- Superfish dropdown menu
- Normalize.css

Decided to jump in with both feet into the Normalize water, and have to admit I'm liking not needing to set new styles for everything... maybe I'm sold?
